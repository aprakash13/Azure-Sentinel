  'This query searches for Info Detections triggered by one of the Vectra AI models. 
  Those are informative, providing security insights, and do not influence the score assigned to the Host.  They provide useful context to a Host or Account for an investigation.
  Some examples: New role seen for a host (e.g DNS server), novel port (used for the first time from this host), etc.'

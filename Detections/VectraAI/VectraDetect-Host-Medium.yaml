name: Vectra AI Detect - Host in the Medium Quadrant
description: |
  'Identifies multiple Detections comming from the same internal Host which caused a move into Detect's Medium quadrant. 
  To meet this requirement, the threat score must be in 0-50 range and the certainty score in the 50-100 range (range is 1-100 for threat and certainty). If required, variables in the query can be adjusted to a different threshold. '

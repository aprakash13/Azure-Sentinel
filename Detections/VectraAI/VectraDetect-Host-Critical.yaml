name: Vectra AI Detect - Host in the Critical Quadrant
description: |
  'Identifies multiple Detections coming from the same internal Host which caused a move into Detect's critical quadrant. 
  The threat and certainty scores for that Host is greater than 50 (range is 1-100 for threat and certainty).  If required, variables in the query can be adjusted to a different threshold. 
  This means that Vectra AI has detected malicous behaviors accross multiple phases of the Kill Chain and it requires immediate investigation.'

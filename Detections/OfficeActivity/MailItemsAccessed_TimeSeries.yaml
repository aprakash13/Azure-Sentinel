name: Exchange workflow MailItemsAccessed operation anomaly
description: |
  'Identifies anomalous increases in Exchange mail items accessed operations. 
  The query leverages KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithms to find large deviations from baseline patterns. 
  Sudden increases in execution frequency of sensitive actions should be further investigated for malicious activity.
  Manually change scorethreshold from 1.5 to 3 or higher to reduce the noise based on outliers flagged from the query criteria.

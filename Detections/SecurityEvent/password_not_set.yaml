name: AD user created password not set within 24-48 hours
description: |
  'Identifies whenever a new account is created with a default password and password is not changed within 24-48 hours.
  Simple version, can be more precise with Windowing, but not necessary if run as an alert on a daily basis.
  Effectively, there is an event 4722 indicating a user enabled and no event 4723 indicating a password was changed within in that day or the next day.'

name: Cisco - firewall block but success logon to Azure AD
description: |
  'Correlate IPs blocked by a Cisco firewall appliance with successful Azure Active Directory signins. 
  Because the IP was blocked by the firewall, that same IP logging on successfully to AAD is potentially suspect
  and could indicate credential compromise for the user account.'

Microsoft continues to see multiple actors taking advantage of unpatched systems to attack organizations running on-premises Exchange Server. To aid defenders in investigating these attacks we are releasing a feed of observed indicators of compromise (IOCs) where Microsoft security products and tooling may not be deployed. 

This feed of malware hashes and known malicious file paths observed in related attacks is available in both JSON and CSV formats at the below links. 

This information is being shared as TLP:WHITE.

  'Today, most compromising sign-in attempts come from legacy authentication. 
   Older office clients such as Office 2010 don’t support modern authentication 
   and use legacy protocols such as IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. 
   Legacy authentication does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   Even if an MFA policy is configured in your environment, bad actors can 
   bypass these enforcements through legacy protocols.'

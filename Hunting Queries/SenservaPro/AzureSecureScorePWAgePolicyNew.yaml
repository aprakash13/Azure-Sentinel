  'This query searches for having found that when periodic password resets are enforced,
   passwords become less secure. Users tend to pick a weaker password and vary it slightly for each reset. 
   If a user creates a strong password (long, complex and without any pragmatic words present)
   it should remain just as strong in the future as it is today. It is Microsoft's official security position
   to not expire passwords periodically without a specific reason, and recommends 
   that cloud-only tenants set the password policy to never expire.'

name: Multiple explicit credential usage - 4648 events
description: |
  'Based on recent investigations related to Solorigate, adversaries were seen to obtain and abuse credentials of multiple accounts 
   to connect to multiple machines. This query uses Security Event 4648 (A logon was attempted using explicit credentials) 
   to find machines in an environment, from where different accounts were used to connect to multiple hosts. Scoring is done based on 
   protocols seen in Solorigate. While this mentions Solorigate, this hunting query can be used to identify this type of pattern for 
   any attacker.

name: Host Exporting Mailbox and Removing Export
description: |
  'This hunting query looks for hosts exporting a mailbox from an on-prem Exchange server, followed by
  that same host removing the export within a short time window. This pattern has been observed by attackers 
  when exfiltrating emails from a target environment. A Mailbox export is unlikely to be a common command run so look for
  activity from unexpected hosts and accounts.

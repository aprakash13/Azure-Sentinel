  'This will help you determine if mailbox access observed with Admin/Delegate Logontype. 
  The logon type indicates mailbox accessed from non-owner user. Exchange allows Admin 
  and delegate permissions to access other user's inbox.
  If your organization has valid admin, delegate access given to users, you can whitelist those and investigate other results.

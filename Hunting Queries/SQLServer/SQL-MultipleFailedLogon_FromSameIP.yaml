name: Failed Logon on SQL Server from Same IPAddress in Short time Span
description: |
  This hunitng query identifies multiple failed logon attempts from same IP within short span of time.
  This query is based on the SQLEvent KQL Parser function (link below)
  SQLEvent KQL Parser provided at https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Parsers/SQLSever

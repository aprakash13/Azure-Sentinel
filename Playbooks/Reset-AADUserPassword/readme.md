# Reset-AADPassword
author: Nicholas DiCola

This playbook will reset the user password using Graph API.  It will send the password (which is a random guid) to the user's manager.  The user will have to reset the password upon login.  
NOTE:  You must create an app registration for Graph API with appropriate permissions.  
NOTE:  You will need to add the managed identity that is created by the logic app to the Password Administrator role in Azure AD.

# Reset-AADPassword
author: Nicholas DiCola

This playbook will reset the user password using Graph API.  It will send the password (which is a random guid substring) to the user's manager.  The user will have to reset the password upon login.

## Prerequisites

- You will need to grant User.ReadWrite.All permissions to the managed identity.  Run the following code replacing the managed identity object id.  You find the managed identity object id on the Identity blade under Settings for the Logic App.
```powershell
$MIGuid = "<Enter your managed identity guid here>"
$MI = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId $MIGuid

$GraphAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
$PermissionName = "User.ReadWrite.All" 

$GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
$AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}
New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $MI.ObjectId -PrincipalId $MI.ObjectId `
-ResourceId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId -Id $AppRole.Id
```

# Cisco Firepower - Add FQDN to a Network Group object

## Summary

This playbook allows blocking of FQDNs in Cisco Firepower, using a **Network Group object**. This allows making changes to a Network Group selected members, instead of making Access List Entries. The Network Group object itself should be part of an Access List Entry.

When a new Sentinel incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs the following actions.
1. For the URLs of the incident we extract the FQDN
2. For the FQDNs we check if they are already selected for the Network Group object
3. For the FQDNs not already selected for the Network Group object we check if there is an existing FQDN object in Cisco Firepower, if it does not exist we create it
4. We add the FQDN object to the Network Group object, so it gets blocked
5. Comment is added to Azure Sentinel incident

Download config file [corelight.conf](https://aka.ms/sentinel-Corelight-conf).\n2. Login to the server where you have installed Azure Log Analytics agent.\n3. Copy corelight.conf to the /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/**workspace_id**/conf/omsagent.d/ folder.\n4. Edit corelight.conf as follows:\n\n\t i. change the path to Corelight logs based on your configuration (line 3)\n\n\t ii. replace **workspace_id** with real value of your Workspace ID (lines 25,26,27,30)\n5. Save changes and restart the Azure Log Analytics agent for Linux service with the following command:\n\t\tsudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart",

# Microsoft Azure Sentinel SAP Continuous Threat Monitoring - Limited Private Preview

The Azure Sentinel SAP Logs connector enables you to ingest your SAP logs with your Azure Sentinel workspace and view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. 

These benefits provide you with more insight into your organization's network, improving your security operation capabilities. 

The SAP logs connector provides both stateless and stateful connections for logs from the entire SAP system landscape, and collects logs from both ABAP and the OS.

**Note**: Once configured and initialized, SAP logs are retrieved for the configured time span, until the 24 hours before the initialization time.
